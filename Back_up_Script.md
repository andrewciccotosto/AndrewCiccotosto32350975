# Backup Script
Now, we need to create a backup script - This will allow us to always have a backup on the virtual machine incase of any mishaps. This will also be set to run daily at 12pm.  

### Creating the backup script
* Firstly, SSH into your virtual machine
* Make a directory called "backuphtml" by using the following
```
touch backuphtml
```
