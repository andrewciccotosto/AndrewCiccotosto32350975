* Scroll down and select "Registered Domains", and then select "Register Domains" in the top right corner.  
* Enter the domain name that you wish to use - in this scenario, it is "andrewciccotosto.com". Note that different Top-Level Domains (TLDs) range in pricing; pick an appropriate one.  

## Creating an A
* When the domain has been registered, go to "Hosted Zones" and click on the registered domain name.
